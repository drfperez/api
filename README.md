API REST Javascript codes. In most cases you need to have an API key in order to be a functional webpage.

1) APOD NASA: A picture of the day by NASA from the simplest obtaining picture of the day only, searching by keywords and 
by date and styling with CSS. In this example the special DEMO_KEY api key is used. This API key can be used for initially exploring APIs prior to signing up, but it has much lower rate limits, so you’re encouraged to signup for your own API key if you plan to use the API (signup is quick and easy). The rate limits for the DEMO_KEY are:
Hourly Limit: 30 requests per IP address per hour
Daily Limit: 50 requests per IP address per day
